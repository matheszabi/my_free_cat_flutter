# my_free_cat_flutter

TheCatApi implementation in Flutter, just a demo app for my portfolio

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In the Flutter after it is downloaded and installed and the initial warnings and errors has been removed it is time to make a Hello World app.
When you try to launch at iOS device it will be new warnings. I have solved like this: 
- open the generated xcode project.
- add a free provisioning profile and select that for signing. This will make a build.
- when you launch from XCode Trust, Allow everywhere, where is asked. - but still not working.
- enter into iPhone Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management. There you have to trust the free signature. - after this it will work in XCode, and later in Android Studio too.
